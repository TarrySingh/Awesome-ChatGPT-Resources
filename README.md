# Awesome ChatGPT | Massive Resources &amp; Collection On The Internet

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

Welcome to the "Awesome ChatGPT Prompts" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model.

The [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses that continue the conversation or expand on the given prompt.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use ChatGPT to generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using ChatGPT!

### Using Unofficial ChatGPT Desktop App

The _unofficial_ ChatGPT desktop application provides a convenient way to access and use the prompts in this repository. With the app, you can easily import all the prompts and use them with slash commands, such as `/linux_terminal`. This feature eliminates the need to manually copy and paste prompts each time you want to use them.

> **Desktop App is an unofficial [open source project by @lencx](https://github.com/lencx/ChatGPT). It's a simple wrapper for ChatGPT web interface with powerful extras.**
